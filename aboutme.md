subtitle: Some cool things about me :)

I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel and moved to Toronto, Canada at the age of 10. Since then I've done some back-and-forth between both countries, altogether spending about half my time in Canada (13 years), half in Israel (13 years) and about a year travelling around the world (yup, I'm 27 now).


Here are some things I ❤ in no particular order:


⚽ Soccer
* Maccabi Tel Aviv has and will always be my team!
* Over the last decade or so I consistently became mesmerized by Leo Messi, granting him the honor of being the only celebrity I'm following on Instagram
* And most importantly I'm always down for some pickup soccer, anywhere anytime (so if you're in the area just let me know!)
  
  
🥽 Scuba Diving
* Ahh, the tranquil world of the water --- nothing can describe the beauty of the marine life
* I earned my advanced open water licence in 2010, and since then I've been diving in many spots (Bahamas, Eilat, Great Barrier Reef) and doing different types of dives (regular dives, wall dives, open water shark dives)
* Next 2 diving destinations --- Sharm el Sheikh and Palau
  
  
📚 Reading
* My guilty pleasure is anything written by David Baldacci
* Historical fiction is my go-to genre (currently reading **Edge of Eternity** by _Ken Follett_)
* Combining my love for the water and my love for reading is one of my favorite hobbies. I can requently be spotted reading at one of the many beaches in Tel Aviv
  
  
🌎 Travelling and meeting new people
* As much as people say the world is small, there is so much to see and learn and of course, let's not forget about the adventures you experience and see!
* In my opinion travelling and immersing yourself in different cultures is a great way to open your mind to new ideas and it enables you to learn new things and grow intellectually and emotionally as a person
* And what better way to meet new people and make new friends
  
  
💻 Coding
* What can be said about a career that's also a hobby 🙂
