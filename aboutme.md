subtitle: Some cool things about me :)
---

I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel and moved to Toronto, Canada at the age of 10. Since then I've done some back-and-forth between both countries. Currently I'm back in Toronto and always open to meet up with new people, play soccer, or go climbing.


Here are some things I â™¥ in no particular order:


âš½ Soccer
* Maccabi Tel Aviv has and will always be my team!
* Over the last decade or so I consistently became mesmerized by Leo Messi, granting him the honor of being the only celebrity I follow on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/benattali/)
* And most importantly I'm always down for some pickup soccer, anywhere anytime (so if you're in the area just let me know!)
  
  
ðŸ¤¿ Scuba Diving
* Ahh, the tranquil marine world --- nothing can describe the beauty of the marine life
* I earned my advanced open water licence in 2010, and since then I've been diving in many spots (Bahamas, Eilat, Great Barrier Reef) and doing different types of dives (regular dives, wall dives, open water shark dives)
* Next 2 diving destinations --- <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sharm+El-Sheikh,+Qesm+Sharm+Ash+Sheikh,+South+Sinai+Governorate,+Egypt/@27.946844,34.2787126,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x14533bca3624d2e3:0xdd987e9c1945fd9c!8m2!3d27.9654198!4d34.3617769" target="_blank">Sharm el Sheikh</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Palau/@5.4403639,130.7994425,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x328445b4a2af0399:0x12ed1edd39a1ebbb!8m2!3d7.51498!4d134.58252" target="_blank">Palau</a>  
  
  
ðŸ“š Reading
* My guilty pleasure is anything written by David Baldacci
* Historical fiction is my go-to genre
* A few books I've read recently: <em>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</em> by Robert Kiyosaki, <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> by Dale Carnegie, and the <em>Clifton Chronicles</em> by Jeffrey Archer
  
  
ðŸ’» Coding
* What can be said about a career that's also a hobby ðŸ˜‰
