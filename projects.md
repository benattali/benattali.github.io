My coding career began in May 2019. Here I will try to have (an updated) collection of my projects. So here we go...

üïí [**app2wait**](https://www.app2wait.com/)  
  A social app that let's you send and record embarrassing challenges of your friends for being late. The later they are the more embarrassing the challenge becomes. This was my final project at [Le Wagon's](https://www.lewagon.com/program) bootcamp, which I created together with [Axel](https://github.com/AxelResnik) and [Ilan](https://github.com/Ilansz). Feel free to check out the [readme](https://github.com/benattali/app2wait) to learn more about it and how to use it.
  
  
üó∫ [**Island hunt**](http://islandhunt.herokuapp.com)  
  A fun and not very useful project. Combining islands and escape rooms into one. Here people can sign up to add or rent an island which acts as an escape room! This project was also cocreated with [Axel](https://github.com/AxelResnik) and [Ilan](https://github.com/Ilansz).
  
  
üç∏ [**Bar chef**](https://bar-chef.herokuapp.com)  
  My very first web app that I created in 2 days. Needless to say, it is extremely simple and limited in its functionality. It let's you add, delete and view descriptions of cocktails. This will definitely come in useful for me someday!
    
Upcoming projects I'm hoping to find the time to work on:
* A to-do list --- to help me keep track of what I need to do
* Some sort of person vs computer game --- for backend and logic building
* Creating a new design for my portfolio page (yes this one!)

**I am currently self-employed. Feel free to check out my [r√©sum√©](https://benattali.github.io/resume) and contact me. Both freelancing and full employment opportunities are welcome :)**
